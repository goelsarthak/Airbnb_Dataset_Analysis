In terms of resturants and bars, there are a couple of places worth recommending - Thai North, which won the award for the best Thai restaurant in Boston as well as Fiorella's, with good-quality Italian classics. Both places offer delivery.  Fuel America in Chestnut Hill is a hip, new place with good coffee and offers a really chill and relaxing space for people looking to do some computer work. CafeNation in Brighton Center as well as Athan's are both laptop friendly cafes as well. For food shopping we recommend Trader Joe's in Coolidge Corner or Newton (both ca. 15 min away by car), although there are a number of convenience stores and places to buy produce within walking distance.  There is a YMCA with a gym and a swimming pool less than a 5 minute walk from the house. It is $40/month and $15 per one-time visit.
